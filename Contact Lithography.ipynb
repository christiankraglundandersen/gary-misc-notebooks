    "# Frensel diffraction and Contact Lithography\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the early techniques developed to pattern computer chips is called \"Contact Lithography\". Contact lithography works by coating a silicon wafer or chip with a UV sensitive polymer called \"photoresist\" and then subsequently exposing it to UV light through a metal mask. After \"developing\" the photoresist (a chemical process that removes the resist where it was exposed, for example), then you can reproduce an exact copy of the patten of the metal mask on your chip.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"attachment:contact_lithography.png\" width=80%></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using classical ray optics to predict the \"shadow\" of the mask, for well collimated light, the reproduction of the pattern of the mask on the wafer should be perfect! However, since light is a wave, it will diffract around the edges of the mask and change the pattern of the light intensity and the exposed pattern can look different than the shape of the mask, as you can see in this example of an electron microscope image of developed photoresist from the lab reports of students from the Nanotechnology course AP3222: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"attachment:litho_examples.png\" width=80%></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "The patterns at the top were supposed to be squares of different sizes: 12, 6, 3 and 1.5 microns. For the smallest square, it doesn't even look square anymore, while even the largest square has strange patterns around the corners. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, you will calculate the diffraction patterns, and use a simple approximation of how the chemistry of photoresist works to see if you can predict similar shapes as seen in the images. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the mask is not in the \"far field limit\" where we did the calculations earlier for Fraunhofer diffraction, we will have to use a different technique for calculating the diffracted light pattern. The example above can be relatively well captured by the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_diffraction>Fresnel diffraction</a> equation for the near-field limit. \n",
    "\n",
    "In <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_diffraction#Fresnel_diffraction>Frensnell diffraction</a>, the electric field at a distance $z$ from the mask opening can be calculated using a 2-dimensional convolution:\n",

    "We will perform this convolution in Fourier space. The transfer function for the Fresnell convolution integral is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"attachment:transfer_function.png\" height=10px></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this formula, $z$ is the distance between the mask and the photoresist layer, $k_x$, and $k_y$ are the wave numbers of the Fourier transform in the $x-y$ plane, and $k = 2 \\pi / \\lambda$ is the wave vector of the incoming light. \n"
