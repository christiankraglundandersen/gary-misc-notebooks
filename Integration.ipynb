    "In this lecture notebook, you will implement the different techniques for the numerical computation of integrals in python and explore aspects of numerical integration.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Learning objectives:** After finishing this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement integration of a function with the trapezoidal rule\n",
    "2. Implement integration of a function with Simpson's rule\n",
    "3. Calculate the integral of a numerical dataset\n",

    "This integral, discussed on page 143 of the book, is actually one that you can calculate yourself and has the exact value of 4.4. This will be handy as we can use this exact value to compare with the values that our numerical calculations give. \n",
    "\n",
    "(The idea, of course though, is that numerical integration is useful for calculating the integrals of functions that are not easy to calculate! But we will do this later, and for now, it is handy to know what the answer is.) \n",

    "\n",
    "To do this, we will create an array x ranging from 0 to 2 with 100 points (just to get a bit of a smooth plot). We will then create second array y which will be our integrand, and then we will plot y versus x.\n",
