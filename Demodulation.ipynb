    "Using the FFT, we can find the steady state frequency that our numerical integration calculation produces, and find that is close to what we would predict (specifically, that the frequency of oscillation is the same as the driving frequency). \n",

    "How can we check the phase of the oscillations? In principle, this is also contained in the phase of the y complex-valued Fourier transform. However, due to the finite sampling of the frequencies in Fourier space from the limited trace lenght, these can be tricky to extract accurately unless the sampling frequency is an exact multiple of the frequency we are interested in. \n",

    "I know the frequency $\\omega$ of the signal, but I want to find the phase $\\phi$ (and maybe also amplitude $A$). To this we can use the following trick: let's multiply $s(t)$ by $\\cos(\\omega t)$. If I do this, I will get the following:\n",
