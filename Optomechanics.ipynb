    "* $x$ is the position of the mechanical oscillator\n",
    "* $a$ is the complex field variable describing the cavity harmonic oscillator\n",
    "\n",
    "The cavity is driven by an external input field $s_{in}$ via an external coupling rate $\\kappa_{ext}$. The mechanics can be driven by external force $F_{ex}(t)$, which could, for example, represent a thermomechanical noise force. \n",
    "\n",
    "The equations of motion describing these dynamical variables are: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",

The coupling constant $G$ (the \"cavity pull parameter\") describes the coupling between the two, and is given by the rate of change of the optical cavity natural frequency with respect to the position of the mechanical resonator:\n",
